    <h2>API Documents</h2>
    <p>
        For working on Laravel API we have to install the API Packages as it files are not loaded like previous version.
        <br>
        We have to run the code on the terminal to get access of the files - <b>php artisan install:api</b>
        <br>
        After running the command we can access the files in the <b>routes/api.php</b>
        <br>
        The routing path will be written in the <b>api.php</b> file of the routes folder.
    </p>
